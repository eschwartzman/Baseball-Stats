This is a python script I wrote in 2014 that uses Regular Expressions to output the batting average of the players on one of the 1940's St. Louis Cardinals teams

This is accomplished by parsing each line of the file, and keeping track of every players' hits and at-bats

To use, simply run the script along with one of the txt files (a year), and all players on that team will have their averages displayed
